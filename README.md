## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to [Sample Tribute Page](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks)


## Requirements

1. Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements

2. You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")

3. You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div

4. Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"

5. Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in #img-div

6. You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page

7. You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab

8. Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size

9. Your img element should be centered within its parent element
